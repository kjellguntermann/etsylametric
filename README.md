# etsylametric
This is an Etsy app for the La Metric Clock. This is currently in development and for private use only. 

Once available, you will need to set it up on your own server and with your own private app because it's resource intensive when public and is also rate limited. See this discussion for more info on that in the future. You will also need to apply for an official developer licence on etsy.com
